Create .ELECTRICAL sections for each type of part (following the datasheets found at BOM)
It's prefered to have the point (0,0) at the center of the rectangular area of the component
Use maximum height (including any tolerance)
Also include the width of the pads (wherever applicable, see datasheets)

Split USB plug in two parts. One placed on TOP and the other on the BOTTOM of the PCB.
There will be a gap between the two of them at the same z-coord with the PCB. 
This is ok, but take care to substract this height from the two USB parts such that
the final "emulated" USB component is exact both in total height and in z positioning.



Smartcard slot shorted by the amount of it's pads length (the LED overlaps with them)

Added PCB slots (1x1 mm) (.BOARD_OUTLINE section)

Removed some drills. They were appearing as components at the casing-engineer tools

Centering USB to PCB:
First calculate the center of the pcb: (y1+y2)/2 and the set that to the USB placement

Moving mounting placement of USB, following the datasheet suggestion

Added tolerances to:
 PCB: The slots where moved away of pcb (following the width tolerance). No resizing of them
 USB: length with general tolerance
 LED: both dims with general tolerance
 Smartcard slot: both dims with general tolerance
assuming that tolerances are halfed at each side
Be carefull about the signs of the coords!

Added height tolerance for USB and Molex

Resized slots' width from 1.00mm to 0.70mm. The center is kept the same
